abstract: "We demonstrate that economic linkages between predictors and real economy, along
with theory-implied parameter restrictions, can substantially enhance the out-of-sample
forecasting performance of equity premium predictions. We introduce a novel empirical Bayes
(EB) framework that effectively captures these economic relationships while accommodating
theoretical constraints on predictor coefficients.
<u>This research is ongoing, and further developments will be provided in future versions.</u>"
