title: "Predicting Equity Premium with Shrinkage Estimation Guided by Economic Theory"
authors: "with Xiaobin Liu, Yanchu Liu and Tao Zeng"
abstract: "We propose an empirical Bayes (EB) framework that enhances equity premium forecasting by integrating economic theory-implied constraints and data-driven shrinkage. Our method optimally balances unrestricted OLS estimates with theory-imposed restrictions, improving predictive accuracy across established predictors, with the out-of-sample  R^2  of the combined predictor reaching up to 15.85%. Empirical results show that EB forecasting outperforms traditional methods, especially when incorporating classic economic constraints. This study highlights the importance of economic structure in time-series predictability.
